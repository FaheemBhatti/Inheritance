Inheritance is used to store information and manage the information in a hierarchical order. It is the process of defining a new class based on an existing class where a child class acquires the properties of the parent class. The subclass (Child/Derived class) inherits the properties of the ParentClass, and the class from which the properties are inherited is called a Super Class (Parent class or Base class).
